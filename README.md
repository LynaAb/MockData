# MockData
Create a CSV of simulated data to design your analysis on, while you wait for
real data

The basic premise is that while simulating data is not difficult, it is 
usually done in a bespoke manner, one project at a time.  With this utility, 
we're hoping to create a quick and easy way to take a sample header row from 
the data that we are simulating, and set a few parameters (ranges, 
distributions, percentage of missing or erroneous data) and create as many 
example rows as we expect will be necessary so that analysis code can be 
written long before a given experiment is finished.
